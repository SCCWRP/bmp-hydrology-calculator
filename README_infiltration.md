A decay rate fits the recession limb of ponded water depth in a structural BMP after a storm event is used to calculate infiltration rate. Depth data, collected using a water level sensor or piezometer, is processed in the following steps:

1\. Data smoothing:

To reduce noise and enhance the clarity of trends in the depth data, a median filter is applied to depth data using Equation 1:


$$
\tilde{y_i} = \text{median}(y_{i-j}, \ldots, y_i, \ldots, y_{i+j})
$$

<div align="right"> 
Equation 1
</div>

where $i$ is the index and $y_i$ is the original depth data before smoothing; the time between $y_{i-j}$ and $y_{i+j}$ is the smoothing window, which is set to 15 min by default (i.e., $t_{i+j}$ - $t_{i+j}$ = 15 min); $\tilde{y_i}$ represents the smoothed depth data.

**Note**: the smoothing window is based on a fixed duration of 15 min, rather than a fixed number of data points, e.g., when the depth data are in 3-minute increments (instead of 1-minute), $y_i$ is the median of 5 points (instead of 15).

2\. Data fitting:

A moving window with a default number of points based on the resolution—equivalent to a duration of 720 min (12 h)—is applied to the smoothed depth data.

$$
y(t) = y_0 e^{-kt}
$$

<div align="right"> 
Equation 2
</div>

where $y(t)$ is the depth at time t, $y_0$ is the initial depth, and $k$ is the rate constant ($time^{-1}$).

The best fit is selected as $R^2$ > 0.999 achieved by fitting the exponential decay model to the smoothed depth data. This way, the best fit regression is guaranteed to be centered on a time window of the depth data that maximizes the regression limb. 

**Note**: A high goodness-of-fit threshold is enforced ($R^2$ > 0.999) to ensure that only the regression limb is considered. If the whole timeseries has been scanned with the 12 h moving window and a suitable model cannot be found, the window size is reduced by 1 h until a suitable fit is found. The minimum window size for a regression limb is 1 h.

Infiltration must occur of at least 1-hr and the change in ponded water depth in the regression window must exceed 2-in for the calculator to return a result. A warning message will be returned by the calculator if either of these conditions are violated.

3\. Infiltration rate calculation: 
Once the best-fitting time window is identified, the **infiltration rate** (length/time) is calculated using Equation 3, based on the rate constant $k$ and the average depth within the selected window (from step 2).

$$Infiltration \ Rate = k \cdot y_{ave}$$  			

<div align="right"> 
Equation 3
</div>

The **average depth** is computed as:

$$
y_{ave} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i
$$	

<div align="right"> 
Equation 4
</div>

where $y_{ave}$ is the average depth within the selected time window, $y_i$ represents individual smoothed depth values within the window, and $n$ is the number of data points in the window.

**Note**: A warning message will be returned if the calculated infiltration rate exceeds 150 in/hr (3810  mm/hr).
